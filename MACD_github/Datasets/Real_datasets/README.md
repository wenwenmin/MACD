 The two real datasets from different human tissues, one of which is murine lymph nodes tissue, and the other is human developing heart tissue . The spatial transcriptomics data (10x Visium) and single-cell sequencing data (10x Chromium) of murine lymph nodes were collected after 48-hour stimulation by MS compared to a PBS control. The spatial transcriptomics data includes 1,092 spots, and the single-cell sequencing data consists of 14,989 cells, with 15 different cell types identified.
The heart  originates from the mesoderm and develops into the cardiac tube, which starts to beat around 21 days after conception. We selected the spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell sequencing (10x Chromium) data from Asp's study, which examined the development of the human heart in early embryos. The ST data includes 210 spots, and the single-cell sequencing data comprises 3,777 cells, with 15 different cell types identified.
